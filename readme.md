#Use Cases Page

##Instructions:
- [ ] Use your HTML/CSS/JS skills to build these two sections of our upcoming Use Cases page: https://www.dropbox.com/s/mf9a4gcp4o8gwk4/Automated%20Insights%20web%20developer%20test.png?dl=0

- [ ] We use Foundation for all the layout of our site, so bonus points for using it in your work

- [ ] The page you create should be responsive as well (at least for phone sizes, you can ignore tablets for this test)

- [ ] We use the font "Roboto"

- [ ] In the top section with the blue background:
Here's the background image: https://www.dropbox.com/s/ya0syy6oi3n0b3f/blue_background%402x.png?dl=0

- [ ] The images at the top of the four boxes in this section should be links. Link to automatedinsights.com for this test. **You can use any images you want, but you get extra credit for using the ones shown in the mockup**

- [ ] The "Learn More" and "Request More Info" buttons should also link to automatedinsights.com

- [ ] In the bottom section with the "Wordsmith for Real Estate" image
The two call-to-action buttons should link to automatedinsights.com

- [ ] The "Wordsmith for Real Estate" image should be replaced with an embedded YouTube video when you click on it. Choose any YouTube video you want!
